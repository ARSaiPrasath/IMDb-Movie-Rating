# IMDb-Movie-Rating
Finding and gaining interesting insights into movies, actors, ratings and collections
In this case study, firstly, we are importing and reading the movie database. Then, we are inspecting the NULL values by finding the percentage of NULL values in each column. After that we are dropping unnecessary columns in the dataframe which are not required. And then we are dropping the unnecessary rows using columns with high value percentages. Then, we have to fill the NaN values. Check the number of retained rows. Then we are performing data analysis process. After the data analysis process, a bar graph has been plotted to have a clear understanding of how the data has been finally shaped.
